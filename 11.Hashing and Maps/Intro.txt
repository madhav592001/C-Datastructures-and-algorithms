why Hashing ? 
play with elements indices . 

                  traverse the array 

two options ->   
                with the use of extra memory we map the 
                elements and indices . 

Problem -> Storing indices of such large elements cuz 
arrays's limit is only 10^8 (that too global) .

            Hashing

      converting elements into smaller elements 
      using somme functions . 

        1234556787  -> h(x) = x%10 

if two BigElements key is equal -> Collision

for handeling Collision -> two methods -
1. seperate chaining
2. open addressing

1. Seperate Chaining -> if collision happens , create chain of values at same key using linked list . 
Worst Case -> O(n) ; 

Load Factor -> arary elements- n and no of keys - b so n/b

2. open addressing - if collision , do probing . 
    probing - using  a second argument called probe number
    in the hash function . 

    probe number depends on the key , hence given by P(k)

Linear Probing - P(k) = a*k + b 
Quadratic Probing - P(k) = a*k^2 + b*k + c 
Double Hashing = P(k,x) = k*h2(x) , h2(x) is a  secondry hash function .
