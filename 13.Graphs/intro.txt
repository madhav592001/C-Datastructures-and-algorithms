                  Graph theories 
1. Nodes - these are the states of vertex . for instance , users in case of facebook. 

2. Edges - links between states in a graph . for instance , connections between users.

Edges are of two types : 
1. undirected : two way edges . 
2. directed : on way edges . 

Representation - 
two types - adjacency matrix and adjacency list.

       adjacency Matrix                  adjacency list

    2d array where a[i][j] == 1         array of lists , where 
    if there if an edge from i to j     a[i] is a list of nodes
    else a[i][j] == 0                   xi that are reachable
                                        from i  .

Depth First Search - 
preorder , inorder, postorder .

key points - 
1. preorder - first time when call comes on the node. 
2. inorder - when the call works inside subtree ( in dfs tree) of that node 
2. postorder - after working on the subtree call comes back on the node . after this , call won't come the same node. 

DFS is implementes using stacks . 

Breadth first search - 
key points -  inplemented using queues . 

differents properties of components of graphs 
1. Weighted nodes - values are associated with nodes . 
2. weighted edges - values are associated with edges .
