Directed graph - a graph with direccted edges is known as directed graph . 

undirected graph - Adjacent vertices are two vertices with a direct edge connecting them . 

degree of vertex -
indegree - no of incoming edges . 
outdegree - no of outgoing edges . 

path between two vertices - 
all vertices whick comes in the path of two given vertices is called their path . 

connected graph -
each node has path from every other node . 

disconnected graph - 
each node does not have path from every node . 

connected components - 
each connected graph is a disconnected graph is called a connected component .

cycles in graph - 
path from a vertex to the same vertex in a graph is known as cycle . 

cyclic graph : graph that contains cycle . 

acyclic graph : graph that does not contain graph . 

tree : 
tree is a connected acyclic graph . 
Properties: 
1. no of edges : n-1 , where n is no of nodes . 
2. there are no cycles present .
3. Each node has a path from every other vertex . 

Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG) : 
1. it has directed edges . 
2. it is acyclic 

complete graph: 
a graph in which each vertex is connected to every other vertex by a direct edge. 
no of edges = nC2 = n*(n-1) / 2 

weighted graph : 
a graph with weighted edges is calles weighted graph .
